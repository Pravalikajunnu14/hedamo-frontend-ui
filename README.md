# Hedamo – Frontend Product Listing Interface

## Overview
This project is a frontend UI implementation for the Hedamo disclosure system.
It focuses on clarity, professional design, and the principle of
disclosure over verification.

Hedamo is a structured disclosure platform and is not a certification,
verification, or approval system. All information shown is declared by
product producers and is not validated or endorsed by the platform.

## Features
- Product listing with name, category, producer, status, and last updated date
- Search, filter (category and status), and sort functionality
- Product detail view with disclosure summary and version history
- Status indicators: Draft, Submitted, Published
- Clear disclaimer for producer-declared information
- Loading, empty, and hover interaction states

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser
3. No additional dependencies or build steps are required

## Notes
- All data used is mock data for demonstration purposes
- Status values (Draft, Submitted, Published) represent workflow stages only
- This interface intentionally avoids language implying verification,
  certification, or endorsement
